# Locate dependent packages here.  Finding them propagates usage requirements,
# if any, to our clients and ensures that their target names are in scope for
# the build.  hsakmt has no cmake project dependencies so there is nothing to
# find.  If we switch to use find_package with external (to ROCm) library
# dependencies (ie libnuma) then those packages should be located here using
# find_dependencies as shown below.
